# Database-project

In my project on the subject of "Database", I composed an ER model of retailer taking 
the Magnum hypermarket network as an example. To have a lot of options, 
I used more than 100 product types. To make it clear which client took what, 
I came up with a new interface as purchases (a shopping basket). 
I made up a chain of work in a hypermarket, which demonstated on the ER model.
I saved all files in one repository.
